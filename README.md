# aoc2022
Try to solve the Advent of Code 2022 in Rust.

## How to use template
Run bash file `get-input.sh` to get inputs for each day. 

Notes: 
- you need to create the `~/data/aoc_hd` by your cookie header value of AoC website.
- the bash script only valids for the AoC 2022 (means days from 1 to 25 - the past). If you run it now, you won't get any inputs. :P I will use this template for next year maybe.
